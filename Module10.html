<h1>Module 10</h1>

<p>So far, I've learned that HTML and CSS coding is time-consuming and complicated. I have<br>
to pay attention to detail like crazy. It's a lot of trial and error, and just when I<br> 
think I have the right code, something gets messed up. My process hasn't been the most<br> 
efficient.  I tend to just try things out rather than plan it out as a skeleton first.</p>

<p>My markup has been messy. There have been a few spots where I would have some style<br>
choices in the html section, and then I would repeat the same style choices in the CSS.<br> 
So I have to work on changing that.</p>

<p>From this point on, I will double-check my html markup to make sure the style choices<br>
are in the CSS only.</p>
