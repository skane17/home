<h1>Module 11</h1>	
	
<p>Honestly, our group was really unorganized. We didn't really get the chance to talk a<br>
lot about design aspects of our sites. A few of us were really behind in the<br>
design process, so some didn't even get the chance to critique and give help<br>
to each other. We were only all there to work together I think two class periods.</p>

<p>I set personal goals to have certain parts done by certain days/times. However, I was<br>
not successful in always reaching those goals, which was why I wasn't able to receive<br>
feedback from my group members.</p>

<p>I, personally, found a lot of help from googling. I don't remember the exact sites<br>
I used but I typically got most of the help from the same sites. I know one of the sites<br>
I used was <a href="w3schools.com">w3schools.com</a>. I found this website<br> 
particularly helpful because there were tons of useful how-to's.</p>
