	<title>Module 11</title>
	
<p>Honestly, our group was really unorganized. We didn't really get the chance to talk a
lot about design aspects of our sites. A few of us were really behind in the
design process, so some didn't even get the chance to critique and give help
to each other. We were only all there to work together I think two class periods.</p>

<p>I set personal goals to have certain parts done by certain days/times. However, I was
not successful in always reaching those goals, which was why I wasn't able to receive
feedback from my group members.</p>

<p>I, personally, found a lot of help from googling. I don't remember the exact sites
I used but I typically got most of the help from the same sites. I know one of the sites
I used was <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/></a>. I found this website particularly
helpful because there were tons of useful how-to's.</p>
